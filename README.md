## Predicting Heart Disease using Machine Learning
> This notebook looks into using various Python-based machine learning and data science libraries in an attempt to build a machine learning model capable of predicting wether or not someone has a heart disease based on their medical attributes.

## Dataset :-
> The original data came from Cleaveland data from thr UCI Machine Learning Repository.

>There is also a version of it available in Kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci
